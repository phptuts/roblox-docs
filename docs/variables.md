# Variables

## Objective

To learn what variables are and how to create them.

## What are variables?

Variables are things used to store data or information about your game in the computer.  In roblox you can store many different kinds of data. 

## How to create a variable

1) Open up a script, see this [script's section](scripts.md#how-to-open-a-script)

2) type in the word local and remember to add a space.

```lua
local 
```

3) Type the name of your variable

```lua
local age
```

4) Type =

```lua
local age = 
```

5) Type the value that your variable is storing.

```lua
local age = 9
```

Remember variable names must start with a letter and can only contain letters and numbers.  Variable names can not contain spaces.

### Variable Examples

Practice creating your own variables. Everything you see in a Roblox game is being stored in a variable.   

```lua
local dogYears = 72
local name = "Amy" -- Because the variable is storing text we wrap it in quotes
local iLikeIcecream = true 
```

## How to print variables

1) Make sure your output window is open, see [intro video](introduction.md).

2) Type in the word print

```lua
print
```

3) Type in ()

```lua
print()
```

4) Type the variable name you want to print

```lua
print(dogYears)
```

5) Play the game and you should see the variable in the output window.
